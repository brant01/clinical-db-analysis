## Session History

### 2025-01-21 - Workflow Simplification & Template Creation
**Duration:** 4 hours  
**Participants:** Claude + Jason

**Accomplished:**
- Created marimo expert agent in `claude_config/experts/domain_experts/`
- Developed three specialized templates with interactive UI:
  - `nsqip_analysis.py` - Adult surgical outcomes
  - `pnsqip_analysis.py` - Pediatric surgical analysis  
  - `ncdb_analysis.py` - Cancer outcomes analysis
- Removed `quickstart.py` and `setup_clinical_db.py`
- Updated all documentation for manual workflow
- Implemented marimo best practices across templates

**Decisions Made:**
- **Manual project creation:** Simpler and more educational than automation
- **Expert Consulted:** Created marimo expert for notebook guidance
- **Three separate templates:** Better than one universal template
- **Interactive UI focus:** Makes analysis more accessible

**Challenges:**
- Complex automated setup was deterring users - resolved with manual process
- Templates needed marimo optimization - resolved with expert guidance

**Next Steps:**
- [ ] Create demo notebooks showing real analyses
- [ ] Test with first external collaborator
- [ ] Consider video walkthrough

**Code Changes:**
- `shared/templates/`: All templates rebuilt with marimo patterns
- `claude_config/`: Added marimo expert, updated all docs
- Root: Simplified README, removed setup scripts

### 2025-06-07 - Repository Unification
**Duration:** 3 hours  
**Participants:** Jason

**Accomplished:**
- Renamed repository from NSQIP-analysis to clinical-db-analysis
- Created unified `db` helper scripts
- Fixed quickstart.py compatibility issue
- Updated documentation

**Decisions Made:**
- **Unified helper:** Single `db` command for all operations
- **Repository scope:** Expanded to include NCDB alongside NSQIP

**Code Changes:**
- Created `db_helper.py` as core implementation
- Updated all references to use `./db` command
